        <p class="my">My response:</p>
    
        
    <p class="Response1">1) In fact, the current software industry can be roughly divided into two major directions. On the one hand, it can be defined as a monopoly software industry, such as Apple and Adobe, which are born for design, and on the other hand, it is an open-source software platform such as GitHub.

        The above two aspects are actually in line with the two-sidedness of things. From the perspective of a monopoly industry, it is not a good thing for a single company to dominate, because they define the standards and trends of design, making the design industry imprisoned to a certain extent. Since practitioners have to rely on this series of software, they will inevitably be standardized by this software, which will weaken their personal style to some extent, and produce design works that are more in line with market requirements. This is an obstacle to the development and improvement of the aesthetic level.
        
        Speaking of the latter, open-source software, compared with monopolistic software, open-source software provides users with more diversified choices. Because this software gives a lot of writing rights, therefore, some people who are proficient in computer compilation can write customized software on the original basis (on the basis of respecting copyright). More extreme is the deciphering of these open-source software by hackers. Although it is an infringement to some extent, these hackers are also flogging software developers to improve their software, so that the original software can be better improved in terms of security and ease of use.
        
        In general, whether it is a monopoly software industry or an open-source software industry, their relationship is complementary. Only when competitors in the monopoly industry appear, can these industries develop better, making software no matter from the ease of use, aesthetics, or price, can be more in line with the needs of the public, as is open source software, but based on this, we all still need to improve copyright awareness, and while enjoying the convenience of open source software, we also need to respect the creators.
        <br><br>
        2) I think one aspect is to absorb a lot of knowledge about aesthetics and design. For example, the history of art in the first academic year is a good supplementary material. We can understand the emergence of an art genre, its age, and even the audience of this art genre. From this knowledge, we can more accurately express our own design works. Furthermore, there is to browse different categories of design works, not limited to knowledge of graphic design works, for example, we can complement our knowledge of aesthetics and design from music, movies, and even different cultures.
        <br><br>
        I think another important skill is the hand-painting skill. Because this skill does not depend on any software, it can truly express the designer's original idea, so it will not be restricted by the software platform.</p>

                        I think the skill for the absorbing knowledge makes senses, which I have never thought about it. It really enhances our understanding of ancient art, and we can applies it to future works. also, the hand-painting is very important as well, the times we practise more for this, the image we create are more pretty.</p>

        <p class="my">My response:</p>
    
    <p class="Response1">1) Universal users can actually be understood as ordinary users because the Internet has been accurately divided into different types of applications, like there are reading types of websites - Amazon- kindle, there is YouTube, which focuses on video sharing, and Spotify, which can send music for you. Each website does its own thing, providing a different experience for the average user. Of course, when we use these websites, we need to open multiple websites according to our own preferences to meet our own requirements. For example, I want to listen to the music and read articles, or even stop to write a note. At this time I need to open at least 3 websites to meet my requirements. In contrast, the personal website mentioned by Schwulst has advantages compared to these mature website platforms. Like the example I mentioned before, I want to combine the two functions of reading articles and listening to music. A personal website can provide such a customized experience. You can add music plug-ins to the web page, and let the music plug-ins push the music style that suits you according to your personal preferences. In addition, you can also save your favourite books in the form of codes on personal websites, these are not available at the same time by ordinary portals, in addition, personal websites will have better privacy.<br><br>

        2) I think I am just a universal user, I am experiencing the convenience that the Internet brings to me, quoting a sentence from Lialina's article "We, general purpose users — not hackers and not people — who are challenging, consciously or subconsciously, what we can do and what computers can do, are the ultimate participants of man-computer symbiosis. ” I guess most of us should be ordinary users because we are not hackers, proficient in code editing, or even able to manipulate trends in the network environment, we are just in the network environment, choose the network platform that suits us. As the above sentence said, most of us are participants, not pioneers who have development capabilities.

        <p class="my">My response:</p>
    
    <p class="Response1">I would use prompt 1 as my response object. In Just van Rossum's "Math, Logic, Design?" lecture, I was most inspired by some images about fonts, patterns and 3D vision written by him and his partners using Python language, and finally using the web platform Drawbot show out.
        I think that the webs created by spiders in nature can be said to be a very programmed work. Although there are thousands of spiders that make webs, the webs they create have certain rules. In Fritz Vollrath and Thiemo Krink's article "Spider webs inspiring soft robotics," scientists use biomimicry to compile machines to mimic spider webs. Among them, in 2. Results, it is mentioned how the garden cross spider weaves its web. The eight legs of the spider have different functions. Among them, the two pairs of front legs are responsible for detecting the existence of the net line and measuring the distance, and the third pair of legs is It is responsible for supporting so that the spider can be fixed on the swaying spider web, and the role of the fourth pair of legs is to help fix the spider silk ejected from the tail of the spider, and logically fix it on the radioactive spider web according to a certain distance.
        The article also mentions that natural factors can also be variables for spider web formation, such as food, water sources, climate, and the presence of predators. In addition, female spiders are generally larger than males because of their reproductive needs, so female spiders will be more efficient and fast in web formation and have higher toughness webs.<br><br>

                    <p>Hi Yuxin, I think your exploration of the process of weaving the web is very helpful for understanding programmatic patterns in nature. The pattern is essentially a set of rules that can be extended to create different variations. Different spiders have different 'approaches' but the principle and base pattern stays the same throughout the species. </p>

        <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/"><img class="Image1", src="images/reading-4.png"></a> 
        </div> 

        <p class="my">My response:</p>
    
    <p class="Response1">I will choose 4 as my answer direction. Steyerl's article points out to us that with the application of linear perspective in different fields, especially in the field of aviation, space satellite cameras can send humans on the earth a three-dimensional bird's-eye view of the entire earth. The picture completely subverts the concept that the horizon is horizontal in human vision. Therefore, different reference objects or different observation subjects will create their own visual forms, just like in JMW Turner's work "The Slave Ship", Turner used his unique perspective vision, completely blurring the junction of sea level and sky, using light, shadow and color to create a very chaotic state, allowing the audience to feel the ship and the slaves being transported all are in dire straits.<br><br>

        In the space created by 3D aerial photography, Steyerl actually hinted a lot about the consequences of this new perspective in the article, one of which is the congestion of the near-Earth space station, because every country wants to launch its own survey satellites, so it will inevitably create a lot of cosmic junk in the near-Earth space. In this article, the picture "Space debris or junk" from Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has pointed out this issue.<br><br>
        
        In addition, what I want to mention is that this three-dimensional perspective view of the universe is actually a great invasion of human privacy, especially the increasingly developed imaging technology, which enables the camera to magnify the display multiple, so as to be able to clearly see every move of the people on the earth. So every country in the military will use this technology to more or less spy on other countries' national conditions and military development. This potential disadvantage is that it will cause wars.<br><br>

                    <p>Hi Yuxin, I absolutely agree with what you said about how 3D perspective can be an invasion of privacy. I think it's interesting what you said about the danger of this in connection with the military, as I hadn't thought about it. For me, I think it's just creepy as a regular citizen to know how often I'm being watched wherever I go. It freaks me out! </p>
