        1)When the mouse moves to the upper navigation bar, you can click to enter different pages, and the hover has special effects;<br><br> 
        
        2)When the mouse clicks the left arrow key, the gallery image will turn the page, and the right side will turn the page to the right; with a hover effect; <br><br> 
        
        
        3)The mouse can drag the picture, you can turn the page arbitrarily, and click the picture to enter different sections; <br><br> 
        
        
        4)The mouse can easily display any picture by clicking the button below.</p>

        1)Each secondary page has a Home button to return to the home page, and there is also a back to the top at the bottom of the page, which can quickly return to the top;<br><br> 
        
        2-3) I divided the 21-day p5 sketches into three categories, static, dynamic and interactive, you can click on different categories to enter the selection;<br><br> 
        
        
        4) Because the page directly embedded in https://p5js.org/ will cause a slow loading speed, I use the image hyperlink and click the image to enter the corresponding p5 interface. <br><br>

            Since ASSIGNMENT III, ASSIGNMENT IV, and READING pages have all used similar typographic styles and effects, the following will take the READING page as an example to introduce.<br><br> 
            
            1) When the mouse hovers over the image, the prompt of “Click on the image to read the article” will be displayed, and you can click the image to enter the corresponding article;<br><br> 
            
            2) In the place of my peer's response, I designed a hover effect, as long as the mouse hovers above, you can see the reply from my peers.<br><br>
