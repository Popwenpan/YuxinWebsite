        <p class="my">My intent:</p>
    
        
    <p class="Response1">I am going to make an infographic about the IMDb app, so the above two pictures are my mind-board. I use IMDb and me as the center, and then continue to spread my thinking, resulting in many different branches. First, I wrote the location when I  use this app. Secondly associated it with my favourite horror movies, as well as sci-fi movies, etc.</p>

        <div id="container1"><p class="R1">Phase2</p></div>

        </div> 


        <p class="my">My intent:</p>
    
        
    <p class="Response1">In the second stage, I first sketched the preliminary shape of this infographic with a draft, which is divided into 5 large sections, the first is the movies I have watched recently, the second is the distribution of the countries where these movies are released, and the third is these movies The release timeline of, the fourth is my rating of the movie and the fifth in the box office of each movie.<br><br>

        On the right is my infographic built with vector graphics in illustrator. The overall layout is similar to the draft. I used a lot of specific colours to separate the different films and blocks, and I added film patterns to the background to make the background more layered.</p>

                <h2>Feedback from Prof. and my peers</h2>
                <p>In the critique session, everyone gave me a lot of constructive comments, the most important of which is that I should discuss more the relationship between me and this app, such as how to use it, how often it is used, where it is used, and what features of this software do I like, what can be done with this app. At the same time, I also recorded similar issues encountered by my peers, so I took notes and told myself that I could record how I interacted with the software in the form of a table. Another is to pay attention to the use of colours, as some of them are too similar.</p>

        <p class="my">My intent:</p>
    
        
    <p class="Response1">At this stage, I adopted the opinions that everyone gave me, so I first drafted a form within a time span of one week. I think one week is more able to fully record the interaction state between me and this app.

        So in the first form, I recorded my use of IMDb from April 26th to May 2nd, and also recorded the different functions I used, and when and where I used it.
        
        The last three sketches are about my future infographic plan, divided into three categories, the first is the home page of the IMDb, the second is search section of this app, and the last is the video section. I wanted to highlight my interaction with IMDb by using the different sections in more detail, so I also did a lot of brainstorming in these three sections.</p>

        <p class="my">My intent:</p>
    
        
    <p class="Response1">This is my final “Me of the Screen”. Due to the size of the text, I divided the infographics into three parts, in addition, consisting of static pictures and dynamic videos.<br><br>

        In the final division, I divided it into six sections, the first is about IMDb's watched and added to watch list features; the second is about how often and where I use the app every day; the third is about what I like the keywords searched in the search section; the fourth is the short reviews and ratings I have written for watched movies; the fifth is which categories of videos I tend to watch in the video section. Finally, the most important feature that IMDb brings to me is that it can show a movie in all aspects. It can show a movie from the director, actors, promotional films and stills, giving me a lot of objective evaluations, so that I could easily find a movie I like.</p>
